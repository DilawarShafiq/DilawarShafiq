Building things at the intersection of AI, Security, and Healthcare. I believe AI agents are going autonomous faster than our ability to trust them. So I'm building the tools to fix that.

## What I'm Building

### AI Security Tools
| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [**Unworldly**](https://github.com/DilawarShafiq/unworldly) | The flight recorder for AI agents — record, replay, and audit everything they do |
| [**RedTeam Arena**](https://github.com/DilawarShafiq/redteam-arena) | AI vs AI adversarial security testing platform |
| [**Code Provenance**](https://github.com/DilawarShafiq/code-provenance) | Detect AI-generated code, find stolen code, catch license violations |
| [**Nietzschian Debugger**](https://github.com/DilawarShafiq/nietzschian-debugger) | The anti-AI — what doesn't kill your code makes it stronger |

### Healthcare & Enterprise
| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [**AutoSapien**](https://github.com/DilawarShafiq/autosapien) | AI & Robotics — humanoid robots, healthcare AI, industrial automation |
| **xEHR.io** | AI-powered EHR/EMR platform (HIPAA, FHIR, HL7) |

## Tech Stack

```
TypeScript  ████████████████████░░  90%
Python      ██████████░░░░░░░░░░░  45%
AI/ML       ████████████████░░░░░  75%
```

**Daily drivers:** TypeScript, Python, Node.js, React, Next.js

**AI:** Claude, GPT, LangChain, Vector DBs, Agent frameworks

**Healthcare:** FHIR, HL7, EDI, HIPAA, ICD-10, CPT, RCM

## The Thesis

> "Everyone is building AI agents. Nobody is watching what they do. That's insane."

I'm building the infrastructure layer that makes autonomous AI agents safe, observable, and accountable. Think Datadog, but for AI agents.
